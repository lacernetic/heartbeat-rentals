Welcome to Heartbeat Rentals! We're Luke and Korina Cernetic, a passionate husband and wife team based in beautiful Colorado Springs. Our journey into the world of dance machine rentals began with our own wedding, where we envisioned creating unforgettable memories on the dance floor. After searching high and low, we realized there were no rental companies that offered the personal touch and reasonable pricing we desired. So, we decided to take matters into our own hands.

With Luke's knack for DIY projects and Korina's eye for detail, we built our very own dance machine. It became the highlight of our wedding, bringing joy, laughter, and a lot of dancing to our special day. Inspired by the happiness it brought us, we knew we had to share this experience with other couples.

At Heartbeat Rentals, we are committed to providing an exceptional, personalized service that puts your needs first. We understand the importance of your wedding day, and we believe that every couple deserves to have a unique and memorable celebration. Our goal is to offer a seamless, enjoyable rental experience that wonâ€™t break the bank.
